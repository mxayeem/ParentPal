I have worked on creating an SRS, sample Test cases and Edge cases


So here’s what I want to build. I’m a parent of two school-going kids. And let me tell you — school communication is a mess these days. Every school has a Facebook group, a WhatsApp thread, emails, SMS… it's like ten different channels. I miss updates. I forget events. Sometimes I don’t even know when my child has homework. I want a single place where schools and parents can talk — a single app that connects teachers, parents, students, and maybe even school admins.
The idea came to me last week when I forgot my son's Parent-Teacher Meeting. I had seen the message on WhatsApp two weeks ago, but it got buried under other chats. I want a mobile app that can solve this once and for all.
The parent should be able to log in using their phone number. Once logged in, they see their child’s profile — their class, section, subjects, and teachers. The app should fetch the data from the school system, or maybe let the school admin upload it from Excel or something.
Then, the app should show a daily feed: homework, announcements, exam schedules, event notices. Kind of like a private Facebook just for that school. It should be secure — only verified parents, teachers, and admins can join. No random outsiders.
I also want to chat with teachers, but not in a messy way. Maybe we could have subject-wise chat groups, or class-wise chats, but also private chat with individual teachers. But chats should be limited by working hours — so parents can't spam at midnight.
Also, I want to get notified about everything that matters — but not too much. Not like spammy notifications. Maybe give users control over what types of alerts they want: urgent announcements, homework only, etc.
I should be able to submit leave requests directly through the app. Like, "My child is sick, will be absent for 2 days" — and the teacher can approve or reject, or just mark attendance accordingly.
Another thing — when the school uploads report cards or test scores, I want to see it directly in the app. Maybe a "Progress" tab for each child. Over time, I want to see how my child is doing — in each subject — so I can help improve where they’re weak.
Also, this app should support multiple kids from the same parent account. I have two kids in the same school, but they’re in different classes. I don’t want to keep logging in/out for each. Just switch between profiles.
Eventually, I want this app to support online fee payments — like, I want to see due dates, total amount, breakdowns, and then pay using bKash or card. Maybe that part can come later, but just plan for it.
Design-wise, I don’t want anything fancy. Just clean, clear, colorful. No ads. It should work on low-end phones. Bangladesh-focused, so don’t make it too heavy.
And please make sure it's safe. We’re dealing with kids’ data. That means good authentication, no public sharing, no screenshots allowed maybe. You decide.
That's it for now. This should fix 90% of the stress I have as a parent.
